# Working with the Alarm Console

The Alarm Console is displayed at the bottom of the Cube workspace. It can contain various lists of alarms, such as the active alarms, masked alarms and information events. However, it is highly customizable, so you can adapt both what it displays and how this is displayed.

- [Manipulating the Alarm Console](xref:Manipulating_the_Alarm_Console)

- [Changing the layout of the Alarm Console](xref:ChangingTheAlarmConsoleLayout)
