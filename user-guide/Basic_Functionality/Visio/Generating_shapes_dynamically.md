# Generating shapes dynamically

It is possible to configure a Visio file in such a way that shapes are generated dynamically in Visual Overview, based on a table, on child items in a view or service, or on alarms associated to a DataMiner object.

This section consists of the following topics:

- [Generating shapes based on table rows](xref:Generating_shapes_based_on_table_rows)

- [Generating shapes based on child items in a view or a service](xref:Generating_shapes_based_on_child_items_in_a_view_or_a_service)

- [Generating shapes that represent alarms](xref:Generating_shapes_that_represent_alarms)

- [Generating shapes for a predefined set of elements, services or views](xref:Generating_shapes_for_a_predefined_set_of_elements_services_or_views)

- [Generating shapes representing bookings](xref:Generating_shapes_representing_bookings)
